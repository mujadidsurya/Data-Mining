36,Little Red Cap,287,Altbier,8,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse,"Notes:Altbier is German for “Old Beer”, this refers to the “old” style of brewing using an ale yeast (As opposed to a lager yeast fermentation which is a relatively new process). This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an “American Twist” while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF. It also won a Silver Award at the 2016 World beer cup. ",5.2,3.63,25,50,27,39,18,47,52,28,4,24,59,6,100,1,Grimm Brothers Brewhouse Little Red Cap,1

41,Über Alt,292,Altbier,8,Rush River Brewing Company,"Notes:Our Alt is a much stronger version of the traditional Dusseldorf Altbiers.

The flavors of the beer are at first as overwhelming as the intense Santa Fe sun. But in the same way our sun gives us the unrivaled brilliant colors of Santa Fe, the potency of Chicken Killer gives us the remarkable spectrum of flavors that can be found in no other beer, in no other city.

109,Arctic Devil Barley Wine,4260,Barleywine - English,98,Midnight Sun Brewing Co.,"Notes:Arctic Devil Barley Wine, aptly named after the ferocious wolverine of the north, is an English-style (meaning malt-inclined) barley wine. Though the recipe and process for Arctic Devil have evolved over the years, it is brewed once a year then aged in oak barrels for several months before the entire batch is blended, bottled and released.In its youth, Arctic Devil gnarls and snarls its way across the palate. Containing this beast of a beer for long periods in oak barrels--some having previously aged port, wine or whiskey--tames the unleashed malt and fierce hop flavors, melding and mellowing this powerful liquid into an incredible elixir worthy of a brewer's table.Each annual batch of Arctic Devil Barley Wine represents the brewers' resolve to create an intriguing and sought-after barley wine by precisely brewing to well-designed specifications, carefully selecting the type and combination of barrels to use for aging, and meticulously checking the beer as it ages. Distinct nuance and complexity are contributed by the wood's previous tenants, resulting in unique flavor profiles in each batch that continue to change over time. We invite you to savor Arctic Devil Barley Wine upon its release then cellar some for future enjoyment.20 IBU	",13.2,4.38,40,60,10,72,69,28,123,23,0,49,23,24,141,1,Midnight Sun Brewing Co.

353,Devotion,1704,Blonde Ale - Belgian,42,The Lost Abbey,"Notes:Belgian Style dry hopped Blonde Ale. It’s an unassuming road leading to the priory. Here, off the corner of two intersecting roads, dedicated monks have been making beer for over 150 years. It’s always been a simple life — the kind that requires they brew only enough to sustain the activities of their monastery. In the silence of passing seasons, they pray, they brew and retire in solitary existence behind the sheltering walls. They live a most interesting life. Most likely one we couldn't sustain.Nearby, each summer, the trellised fields spring to life as rows of resinous green cones are trained toward the heavens. Rumor is some monks love these hops and being surrounded by budding yellow aromas and the leafy pungent fields inspired them.

This German lager beer is rich and malty and brewed to an alcohol strength of 6-7%. “Ice Bock” is produced when a Bock beer is partially frozen in order to increase it’s alcohol content. In this process, some of the water content turns to ice, effectively strengthening the flavor and alcohol of the beer. We take this process one step further. After the initial freezing, the beer is decanted off the ice and frozen a second time. The resulting beer is a deceptively smooth and amazingly strong lager.

A generous quantity of pilsner malt is joined with a little bit of caravienne for color and some carapils for body, along with plenty of Munich malt for flavor and aroma. This beer is lightly hopped with Yakima Perle and German Hallertau.The traditional symbol for bock beers of all varieties is the billy goat. This is the reason that Free State named this Maibock after Dr. John R. Brinkley, a.k.a. ""The Goat Gland Doctor."" In 1920s Kansas, Brinkley gained notoriety for his alleged cure for infertility that involved the surgical implantation of goat glands in the affected individuals. Some farmers are even said to have brought along there own goats because they felt them to have superior sexual prowess.	",6.5,3.6,20,38,9,37,11,41,46,18,1,17,64,5,87,1,Free State Brewing Co.

This means we stuffed as many full-cone hops – fresh from the fields – as we could into a lager tank and filled the rest of the space with our bock beer. The beer was then left to mature for two months before it was once again enriched with hop oils.To preserve all the wonderful flavors developed during the process, this beer goes directly into bottles without filtration.Light-golden in color with a mild cloudiness, our Saphir-Bock shimmers tantalizingly in the glass. The floral hop aromas harmonize perfectly with the warm ester notes. When taken to the nose, you may make out hints of mandarin, lychee, and ripe pears. On the tongue, you'll immediately be struck by the full-bodiedness. As it moves back across the palate, the hop notes open up, revealing themselves in all their glory in the finish. The pleasant fruity-bitterness travels up the throat, across the palate, and into the nose, where it is greeted, once again, by the sweet ester notes of the yeast.This constant play between full-bodied maltiness and floral hoppiness ensures an unforgettable drinking experience.

700,Sanctification,5101,Brett Beer,117,Russian River Brewing Company,"Notes:Who’s afraid of the ""big bad BRETT?"" We’ll tell you who: winemakers! Because of our close proximity to several hundred wineries, we often get winemakers visiting our brewery. (After all, it takes a lot of great beer to make great wine!) Because we use 100% Brettanomyces yeast to ferment Sanctification, most winemakers will only smell the glass, and only a very few will venture to taste the beer. They think the Brettanomyces will attach to their clothing and end up in their winery. A simple solution was offered: keep a smudge pot burning at the door of our brewery so they can burn their clothes when exiting, but even that was not enough. After giving it more thought, we concluded that winemakers think Brettanomyces might scar their taste buds and possible even permeate their skin? Either way, Sanctification is one of the most unique beers you will ever taste! It was fermented with 100% Brettanomyces, rather than the traditional Saccharomyces.

Brooklyn Brown Ale combines the best of those classic styles and then adds an American accent in the form of a firm hop character and roasty palate. A blend of six malts, some of them roasted, give this beer its deep russet-brown color and complex malt flavor, fruity, smooth and rich, with a caramel, chocolate and coffee background. Generous late hopping brings forward a nice hop aroma to complete the picture.

1053,Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,504,Dubbel,14,Brouwerij Westmalle,"Notes:Westmalle Dubbel (7%) is a dark red-brown beer with a rich, complex taste thanks to re-fermentation in the bottle. You pick up touches of caramel, malt and fruity esters reminiscent of ripe banana. The beer pearls beneath a covering of dense, cream-coloured froth. A lovely lace pattern forms on the inside of the glass once emptied. The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish.	",7.0,4.2,15,30,24,47,39,23,113,49,0,89,33,31,92,1,Brouwerij Westmalle Westmalle Trappist Dubbel,1

1128,Good Harbor Golden Ale,1829,Farmhouse Ale - Bière de Garde,44,Leelanau Brewing Company,"Notes:This Golden Ale is Inspired by Franco-Belgain bière de gardes, but not exactly fitting the profile of its European counterparts, this beer is best described as a Michigan Bière de Garde. Hand-crafted by Ron Jeffries at his Jolly Pumpkin Brewery in Dexter, which is consistantly rated as one of one of the best in the world, all of the Leelanau Brewing Company beers are distingushed by their time spent in a large French oak barrique prior to bottling and re-fermentation. The wild yeasts inhabiting the brewery give all the beers made there a common thread, creating a family of beverages with rare harmony, despite their diverse styles.Decidedly refreshing despite the 7.5% abv, this style of beer was originally brewed in the slow winter season as payment for farmhands in the summer. We certainly don’t mind sitting down after a long day of work and breathing deep the symphony aromas wafting from the lofty, lacey head burgeoning from our tulip glass. Subtle notes of peaches, apricots, canned pineapple, bitters, and a faint herbaceousness belie the smooth and delicate taste. The slightly malty, fruity body quickly transitions effortlessly to a crisp, dry and somewhat tart finish. Signature hints of French oak and the complex yeast character place this all-natural beer among the best saisons, stock ales, and farmhouse styles of Michigan, France & Belgium.

Upon setting out to create the first summer addition to the Stateside line up of ales; the feeling that almost instantly came to me was that of beauty & cleansing. Many summer offerings tend to lack the complexity of their bigger, colder season counterparts; so my goal was to craft an ale of extreme balance with a delicate complexity that allows for contemplation while also providing quaffable refreshment. Starting with a base of German wheat & pale malts this crisp slightly hazy foundation was then accented with a blend of Sterling & Citra hops providing a intricate blend of herbal grass & tangerine citrus flavors and aroma. To pull this all together and to complete the ’cleansing’ aspect of my vision I gently finished the ale off with a touch of white sage, lending a mild earthy spice character to the blend. Of course let’s not forget our house saison yeast that brought all the elements together leaving a dry yet intricate finish.

With flavors of fresh berries and rye, Soft Parade finishes dry and eminently drinkable.Soft Parade was originally developed because Joe Short wanted to create a beer that incorporated a medley of berries, had a great color, and appealed to wine drinkers. The name Soft Parade stemmed from two moments in Joe Short’s life. First, because Joe worked as a brewer at the Traverse Brewing Company and The Doors album, The Soft Parade, played every day at the end of the brew shift. The second moment occurred when Joe was driving by himself, flipping through CD’s in his car, and came across The Soft Parade album again. At the time, The Soft Parade beer had not been named and it dawned on Joe that the medley of fruit infusing into the golden beer reminded him of a soft parade. That day the beer was named!

Our destination is 9,000 years ago, in Northern China! Preserved pottery jars found in the Neolithic villiage of Jiahu, in Henan province, have revealed that a mixed fermented beverage of rice, honey and fruit was being produced that long ago, right around the same time that barley beer and grape wine were beginning to be made in the Middle East!Fast forward to 2005. Molecular archaeologist Dr. Patrick McGovern of the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology calls on Dogfish Head to re-create another ancient beverage, and Chateau Jiahu is born.In keeping with historic evidence, Dogfish brewers use brown rice syrup, orange blossom honey, muscat grape, barley malt and hawthorn berry. The wort is fermented for about a month with sake yeast until the beer is ready for packaging.10 IBU	",10.0,3.79,5,40,16,24,33,12,145,68,0,96,23,8,64,1,Dogfish Head Brewery Chateau Jiahu,1

You see we had a couple of really good years (thank you very much) and so heading into this season while we are awaiting the January delivery of a new brewhouse we are jammin’ along brewing 80 barrels of IPA and PILS and such every 3 hours. A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga’ every 5 hours, that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga’ brewed, we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever.

Hop extracts are for the BIG brewers, he thought - suitable only for crummy sub-standard and barely-passable industrial lagers, not the subtle and elegant craft beer made here. But wrong he was. The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs. In this case the mountain of extracts will replace the mountain of hop vegetative material in the kettle thus creating cleaner hop flavors and preventing the otherwise spinach-like mess of a kettle full of super-hopped wort from clogging up a pump or worse. The sensuous honey-like amber ooze was administered intravenously to the wort kettle and the sacrament was complete. Another kettle of Hop Stoopid is once again raised up and fermented on high.

We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have work so hard to retain.If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom -- leave them in the can while pouring.

The result is a wonderfully flavorful beer, smooth, refreshing and very versatile with food. Dry-hopping is largely a British technique, which we’ve used in a Viennese-style beer to create an American original.

Now it's back, new and improved, for those who finally want a better lager.In a craft world dominated by hoppy beers, we have gone back to basics with Firestone Lager. this is our hardest beer to make--and our easiest one to drink. Made in the classic all-malt Munich Helles style, Firestone Lager demands technical perfection from our brewing team, with a transparent canvas that would otherwise reveal the smallest flaw. Gambrinus pilsner malt establishes a crisp, dry base with a soft mouthfeel, while noble German hops provide just a whisper of bitterness. The result is an impossibly smooth and immensely drinkable beer that aims to help redefine American Lager. In the words of Brewmaster Matt Brynildson, ""Firestone Lager is made for drinking, not thinking. It's all about enjoying a good, clean beer.""

2350,Asahi Super Dry,3551,Lager - Japanese Rice,82,Asahi Breweries Ltd,"Notes:Asahi Super Dry was a direct result of extensive market research which indicated a consumer preference for a more palatable beer with less maltiness, relatively high alcohol content and a light aftertaste, that paired well with the changing Japanese diet. With this insight Asahi used its brewing knowledge to develop a beer with a crisp bite, refreshing taste and clear finish to satisfied this requirement. Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the “Dry Wars” in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally. However Asahi has stood the test of time and now years later Super Dry continues it legacy as the world’s premier dry beer. Special Yeast - Asahi # 318 is the proprietary ingredient used to give Super Dry its “dryness”. This special strand of yeast produces high attenuation during fermentation in conjunction with the choice grains.Finest Ingredients – Asahi uses select grains and hops sourced worldwide based on strict criteria to maintain flavor consistency and promote sustainability. Barely with high starch content and both noble style bitter and fine aroma hops are key contributors to Super Dry’s smooth taste.

It is an unfiltered, naturally cloudy beer with a low carbon dioxide content, and it contains all of the natural sediment. As a result, Kellerbier is rich in valuable nutrients such as yeast, protein, minerals and vitamins.Following the old family tradition, Zeppelin beer is brewed in accordance with the German Purity Law of 1516. As with all of our beers, we use the world-famous Tettnanger aromatic hops, high-quality barley grown in upper Swabia and pure water from the uplands of the Alps. We give the dark amber Zeppelin beer seven weeks to quietly mature. The result is a fully flavoured, mildly malty Kellerbier of the highest quality and goodness with an alcohol content of 5.2 percent. It’s a beer which is almost unrivaled in taste, thanks to its extremely delicately spiced, original flavor.

And Aufkräusen (literally to kräusen it up), refers to a historic brewing technique in which some green beer is added to a fully-matured lager. This is a very old and very typically German tradition, and today even English-speaking brewers refer to this technique as krausening. Krausening brings the vibrant freshness of young beer to the more refined, austere flavors of a fully-matured lager.Aecht Schlenkerla Kräusen starts out as normal Helles Schlenkerla Lager and matures for months in the old rock cellars underneath the brewery. Just before filling it is blended using the before mentioned ""Kräusen"" technique with classic Märzen Rauchbier.

In the 19th century, Faro was very popular in the Brussels area. Various folk traditions were associated with it, and this ambrosial drink flowed abundantly, thanks to its relatively neutral but extremely pleasant flavour. Today, Timmermans Faro is still brewed using the methods and recipes of days gone by, and meets with unanimous approval.

At that time (1986), ""Raspberry-Lambic"" already was synonymous with a sweet, artificially flavoured beer. This is why we decided to distinguish our beer from the other raspberry beers. Raymond proposed to call it a rosé, dedicated not to Bacchus but to Gambrinus.The process to make this beer is identical to the one to make Kriek. When young, the Rosé de Gambrinus will still present its full fruity taste. Later on, the lambic taste will become dominant at the expense of the fruit taste.

2824,Kriek,5175,Lambic - Fruit,119,Brouwerij Lindemans,"Notes:Also known as Kriek FoudroyanteWe've already told you that our family never does anything the way other people do. Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuvée René, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU	",3.5,3.89,15,21,22,28,10,3,87,89,0,102,7,9,13,1,Brouwerij Lindemans Lindemans Kriek,1

These bottles are then stored in our cellars for at least five months so that the kriek lambic can develop into a beautiful, traditional, and refined Oude Kriek.

2886,Gueuze,5237,Lambic - Gueuze,120,Brouwerij Lindemans,"Notes:From the brewery:There are several stories to explain the origin of the term 'gueuze'. This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuvée René.

2914,Iris,5265,Lambic - Traditional,121,Brasserie Cantillon,"Notes:It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.	",6.5,4.37,0,10,69,34,16,90,59,191,4,123,100,17,56,1,Brasserie Cantillon Cantillon Iris,1

3123,Old Peculier,4311,Old Ale,99,T & R Theakston Ltd.,"Notes:Old Peculier is possibly one of the country’s most well-known and loved ales. This unique, beautiful brew is often imitated but never matched and is sold literally all over the world. With countless awards to its credit, it is something of which every Briton can be very proud and is the epitome of the greatest of British brewing tradition.In the early years of the modern brewing era, about two hundred years ago, many brewers produced a dark, strong ‘stock’ beer in the winter months, to provide a base amount of fermented beer to add to beers brewed in the rather more volatile months of the summer.Old Peculier probably owes its origins to this. The name pays tribute to the unique ecclesiastical status of Masham as a ‘Court of the Peculier’ and is also reference to the strong characteristic of the beer! For many years it was affectionately referred to as Yorkshire’s ‘Lunatic’s Broth’.	",5.6,3.98,30,65,10,36,22,40,88,32,2,61,38,9,97,1,T & R Theakston Ltd. Theakston Old Peculier,1

We then bridge the old world with the new with the two most distinctive hops Bramling Cross and Jester, both descendants of English and North American varieties.Malts: Crystal, Two-RowHops: Bramling Cross, Jester, Citra, Cascade, ChinookOriginal Gravity: 13.5° PlatoIBU: 32	",5.5,3.44,25,50,27,30,9,90,23,45,4,52,105,1,46,1,Matt Brewing Company Saranac Pale Ale,1

3213,Orval Trappist Ale,2051,Pale Ale - Belgian,49,Brasserie d'Orval S.A.,"Notes:Orval beer is a high fermentation beer. The ageing process adds a fruity note, which strikes a subtle balance between the beer’s full-bodied yet complex flavour and bitterness.The beer was first brewed in 1931 and owes its unparalleled taste to the quality of the water, the hops and the yeast used. The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls.

When coming up with the recipe for Pils owner/brewmaster, Rick, brewed 17 batches of this beer to make it perfect. The recipe is based on the traditional and beloved Pilsner Urquell, which is why we have chosen not to filter our beer and why our lagering time is as long as it is--from brewday to when we can or keg Pils it is at least eight weeks. Our Pilsner is a little more golden, rounder, and a little more malt driven than many other versions. The beer possesses strong hop character that is balanced by its rich, round, malty palate.

3374,Pilsner,2812,Pilsner - German,65,Brooklyn Brewery,"Notes:Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New York’s pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.	",5.1,3.67,25,40,35,29,7,54,13,8,8,9,72,2,49,1,Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Pilsner,1

It really isn't as crazy as it sounds. 250 years ago virtually all beers were smoked (it's true, Google it!), but with the dawning of the industrial revolution most of the smoke lifted. However, in the German town of Bamberg the flame has quite literally been kept alive and to this day the town’s brewers produce world renowned beers brewed with their own special rauchmalz (beechwood smoked malt).We’ve taken our best porter recipe and added a good measure of that same Bamberg Rauchmalz. The smoke mingles beautifully with the rich, dark roasted chocolate flavours of the porter without being overpowering. Although it pairs extremely well with smoked seafood, barbeques, strong cheeses and hearty stews, its food friendliness isn’t limited to savouries; chocolate and caramel based deserts are great companions too! Trust us; it really isn't as crazy as it sounds.40 IBU	",6.2,3.88,20,40,19,104,18,60,89,25,0,28,37,118,133,1,8 Wired Brewing Co. The Big Smoke,1

3862,Three Philosophers - Bourbon Barrel-Aged,4400,Quadrupel (Quad),100,Brewery Ommegang,"Notes:We have a new twist on an old favorite coming out in February. Our unique Three Philosophers Quardupel Ale is universally-known as the preferred elixir of life’s meditators, thinkers and theorizers. Now, thanks to Brewmaster Phil Leinhart and the 24 bourbon barrels he got his hands on, mullers of life’s mysteries can ponder all the more deeply. “We’ve experimented with barrel aging in the past and had great success,” said Brewmaster Phil Leinhart. “Three Philosophers is such a lovely, complex beer and it ages so beautifully that we thought it the perfect fit for pairing with bourbon barrels. The result is exactly what we hoped for: even more complex flavors and a slightly fuller body than the standard. We’re sure this’ll be a crowd pleaser.”Like the original, Bourbon Barrel-aged Three Philosophers pours a deep burgundy hue with a fluffy, off-white head. Patience through the aging process rewarded the brewers with flavors of caramel, raisin, dried fruit, molasses, and vanilla and aromas of oak, vanilla, and subtle hints of cherry.

Two kinds of malted rye provide spicy sweetness, giving way to notes of caramelized wood and the citrusy tang of Perle, Magnum, and Saphir hops before easing into a dry, lingering finish.47 IBU	",12.0,4.25,10,80,11,52,102,18,71,14,1,19,11,28,161,1,Boulevard Brewing Co.

Elegant and rustic, and full of complex flavors, berries, spice, and a hint of nuttiness, this is a great beer to share with friends on a special occasion.Born of the fortuitous encounter between a strong stout and fermented apricots from the Valais, which never reached the distillers. Our Oud Bruin (Flemish for “Old Brown”) is a rather unorthodox take on the style. It nevertheless boasts the typical sweet and sour balance between a solid malty, toffee-like, chocolaty, roasted and fruity backbone. Into this the fermented apricots merge seamlessly, with their lactic sourness, leathery and horse blanket notes from wild yeasts and a discrete touch of apricot deep down. It finally evolves harmoniously into a slightly bitter finish. Altogether a pretty unique yet very drinkable beer.

After the main fermentation and the second lagering the ""Vichtenaar"" undergoes a third fermentation in oak casks for several months. The oak casks are large vats with a capacity ranging between 5000 and 25000 liters. The ""Vichtenaar"" is a traditional and typical beer for West Flanders, in the Northwest of Belgium. The taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" can be described as slightly acidic and complex and this through the long fermentation in oak casks. The fresh taste of the ""Vichtenaar"" makes it a particularly thirst-quenching beer, especially during the summer months. The ""Vichtenaar"" is also one of the last old-Flemish red-brown beers which are matured in oak casks and is especially appreciated for its authenticity by the beer connoisseur. In 1958 “Brewery Verhaeghe” obtained for its beer ""Vichtenaar"" the first prize in the international contest for beers in Ghent.

The fruit is sourced from the region around Sint-Truiden in Limburg (Belgium).Unlike the most famous fruit beers the basic beer of the ""real cherry beer"" is not a Lambic but a West-Flemish red-brown ale aged in oak wood. About mid-July at the picking, the Northern cherries are brought in at the brewery and laid in on the base beer.Because the taste of the cherry fruit varies from year to year and this according to the number of hours of sunshine or rain, the kriekenbier at its final composition is blended with cherry beer from the year before and two-year old cherry beer. This with the intention of becoming a more constant taste of the ""real cherry beer"" over the years.

Maybe because it is the beer that it takes more time before leaving the brewery, or maybe for a certain analogy with the trade of enologist, it is always very emotional when myself and Luca (a solid presence at the brewery) find ourselves between sour splashes and leftover pieces of fruit that remind me the “visciole” (morello cherry) my grandfather used to eat while playng cards. It starts with an acidic base that has made at least 2 years of mixed fermentations (conducted mainly by lactic, acetic bacteria and brettanomyces) which have at least 6 months macerated cherries and sour cherries, blend with a small part of chimera and some young beer; the blend is put in numbered bottles indicating the year of the cuvée, which refined further 12 months before selling.La Luna Rossa is like a kriek on the basis flemish red, has an extraordinary complexity associated with a wonderful elegance, for lovers of the genre is definitely one of those beers that you find it difficult to forget.- GiovanniIn the glass, to the nose and in the mouth …Born from the blend about different beers, some of them aged in barrels until 2 years with the addition morello and marasca cherries.

The nose is defined by equal parts bright lactic acidity and cherry notes with a hint of coriander. On the palate, the strong lactic acidity is accentuated by the natural tartness of the cherry juice. Quantitatively, this beer is quite sweet, but we find that this level of residual sweetness is just enough to balance the acidity and that the overall perception of the beer is actually quite dry. The beer finishes very clean and in conjunction with the salt in the finish, it definitely makes you want to come back for more.pH - 3.4Total Acidity: 9.9 ml/100g	",8.3,3.86,10,15,47,33,25,6,53,148,29,125,21,1,57,1,Southern Tier Brewing Company Imperial Cherry Saison,1

While the porter style was developing, some brewers produced a stout porter and over time generated a new style known simply as stout. These beers traditionally contain a distinct roasted malt flavor and can run the gamut from a dry stout, such as Guinness to a sweet stout such as Watney’s Cream Stout. Our Black Mocha falls in the sweet stout range and derives its chocolate and coffee tones from the use of appropriate roasted malt grains and is very often used as an after dinner libation or an accompaniment to dessert.

4762,Black Chocolate Stout,4104,Stout - Russian Imperial,94,Brooklyn Brewery,"Notes:This is the famous Brooklyn Black Chocolate Stout. In the 18th century, Catherine the Great, Empress of Russia, ordered a stout to be sent to her from England. This beer was brewed strong and hoppy to survive the sea voyage, and it arrived in perfect condition. Soon ""Russian Imperial Stout"" became the toast of the Russian aristocracy. Brewed since 1994, our Black Chocolate Stout has itself become a modern classic, heralded the world over. It achieves its dark chocolate aroma and flavor through the artful blending of six malts and three distinct mashes. Properly kept, it will improve in the bottle for many years. This stout is the toast of the winter season in many countries, and there is nothing better to enjoy with chocolate desserts, cheesecake, ice cream, fine cheeses and roaring fireplaces.Given this beer’s higher ABV and sturdy character, we think it’s a prime candidate for cellaring. Find a cool, dry spot away from light sources, and see how it changes in the years to come. You never quite know what will happen when you age a beer: perhaps the body will smooth out, notes of vanilla, oak, and tannins will come to the front, or hints of leather and soy sauce will make themselves known. No matter what, remember that beer is meant for drinking, so don’t keep it to yourself for too long.

Such were the final days of the old empire. Reactionary, decadent, sputnik, stroganoff, weird, and drunk. But even as the proletariat countryside labored under inhuman conditions and the threat of being sent to a futile war in the east, they wisely took the time to slam back an Imperial Stout or two. After all, life can be a real 'suka' as they said in the old country. Big, black, bourgeois, Bolshoi, belligerent, buxom, and scary.

Naturally, because of its unique fermentation with native microorganisms, the beer is different than previous versions. We’re quite happy with how it turned out, and we’re excited to release it. However, for fans of the original Black Metal, or “O.G. Black Metal” as its known, we feel as though we need to borrow the famous line from Stone Brewing Co.‘s Arrogant Bastard Ale: “You probably won’t like it.” Like all our beer, the flavors and aromas of the current batch of Black Metal are very much fermentation derived and rely far less on copious amounts of malt and hops. This is what we like to drink. We like dry, balanced, drinkable, tart beers with some interesting yeast complexity. We feel we’ve achieved this with Black Metal, and hope others enjoy it as well. There will be those that don’t, however, and wish we’d return to the days of fermenting this beer with English ale yeast, and that’s OK.

Elbow’s sweets are distinguished by their use of unusual and sometimes surprising flavors and ingredients; in that adventurous spirit we joined forces to bring you a very special Chocolate Ale.In developing this beer, Elbow and Boulevard brewmaster Steven Pauwels sought to harmonize the interplay of chocolate and malt, with each supporting and enhancing, but not overwhelming, the other. Just the right chocolate was essential. Elbow recommended a rare variety from the Dominican Republic, prized for its robust flavor and aroma, and a personal favorite. More than a mere flavoring, the chocolate — in the form of nibs, or crushed, roasted beans – was incorporated into the brewing process itself.24 IBU	",8.7,3.76,40,100,10,132,24,46,124,16,0,22,25,22,169,1,Boulevard Brewing Co.

So he picked the mailbox, and we weren’t about to argue with him. You can say what you want about him, but that Death sure has a big heart. So anyway...we brewed this beer with a Trappist yeast strain so it is very traditional. The flavors are incredibly complex with notes of mild fruit and finishes with a bit of clove.

Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.19 IBU	",4.8,3.43,10,35,9,36,4,16,25,54,0,71,25,27,80,1,Harpoon Brewery UFO Hefeweizen,1

Therefore, the Heart of Gold beer aging in the barrel starts to absorb back some of the Devil’s Cut and hence the name ""Devil’s Heart of Gold"". We took our Heart of Gold and aged it in a Knob Creek 9-year old barrel from our friends at The Wine and Cheese Place in October 2011.

5395,West Coast Wheat Wine,4787,Wheat Beer - Wheatwine,108,Baird Brewing Company / Fishmarket Taproom,"Notes:Brewer's Notes: Wheat Wine is a beer style born on the U.S. West Coast in the 1980s (legend has it that the style was conceived and first crafted at a small brewery-pub in Sacramento, California). It has as its progenitor the English Barley Wine beer style. Wheat Wine, as a beer style, is characterized by a massively rich complexity imbued with a tenaciously strong-willed sense of balance. It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States. Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is crafted in homage to the skilled brewing artisans and fearless beer entrepreneurs that have pioneered craft brewing on Americas great West Coast.Baird West Coast Wheat Wine is a heavyweight  this year (2005) tipping the scales at approximately 9.5% alcohol by volume. 50 percent of the fermentable extract is derived from malted wheat, and this lends a quenching drinkability rare to beers of this strength. This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel. The hops once again are 100% American West Coast types; this year, though, large additions of Vanguard and Sterling render the hop character softer and spicier than last years boldly citrus performance.

For this batch, we stepped up the spice and cider additions. Instead of 200 lbs of apples, Ben pressed 300 lbs of organic Fuji apples for a total addition of 25 gallons of fresh pressed cider, which was added to the whirlpool in order to really bring out the cider character. The amount of cilantro was nearly quadrupled with 4 lbs total, which was pureed with a portion of the cider and then added after the boil was done. The cayenne was doubled, but added directly before the beer was transferred from the kettle to the fermenter in an effort to minimize the burn while increasing the flavor and aroma contributed. A different type of wit yeast was used and then fermented slightly cooler to keep the yeast character minimal and act as a supporting role to the main players the cider and spices. Lastly, this batch was boiled for less time than the original batch, leaving the beer with a lighter straw color than the amberish hue of batch #1.Overall, Positive Contact is characterized by its bright spritzy cider character and autumnal herbal quality derived from the cilantro, cayenne, and yeast.19 IBU	",9.0,3.85,10,20,31,30,30,10,82,93,0,96,57,79,35,1,Dogfish Head Brewery Positive Contact,1
